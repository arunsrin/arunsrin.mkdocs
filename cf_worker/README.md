# Hello

This is a reference folder containing the code that is deployed as a Cloudflare
Worker. The purpose is to display a 'Summarize this page' button on each page
of the site. On click, it submits the URL to the worker, which loads the
content, sends it to chatgpt (4o-mini), which summarizes the page and returns
the result.

Full credit to ChatGPT for working me through the entire solution :)
