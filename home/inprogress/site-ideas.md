# Site Ideas

This site currently uses [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/). I like it
because it's the only static site generator I've seen that supports a
search bar. Also it's written in python, which is a language I'm
already comfortable with. Here are some other frameworks that look interesting for other reasons.

## Alternate frameworks

- [Scribilo](https://www.nongnu.org/skribilo/doc/user.html) - Written in Guile Scheme. Programmable.
- [Pollen](https://docs.racket-lang.org/pollen/) - Written in Racket. Programmable again.

## Content ideas

- [meta-knowledge](https://github.com/RichardLitt/meta-knowledge) - People who dump all they know into a version controlled, public site like mine.
- [Sample gitbook knowledge wiki](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/)
