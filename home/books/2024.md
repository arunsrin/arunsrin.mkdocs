## February

### Who was Vincent van Gogh, by J. Hulsker

A pleasant read in a single sitting. A nice overview of van Gogh's life and
works.

### The Organized Mind, by Daniel J. Levitin

Sounded like a book on productivity but ended up covering a whole bunch of
things about probability and so on.

### The Man Who Was Thursday: A Nightmare, by G.K. Chesterton

Absolutely enjoyable. I usually judge books on how they 'surprise' me and I'm
happy to say that every time this book seemed to be going in a predictable
direction, it veered off course into a completely different one. Highly
recommended.

### The Miniaturist, by Kunal Basu

About a painter in Mughal India. A pleasant evening's read.

## January

### The Elements of Eloquence, by Mark Forsyth 

I'm not sure that anyone could remember all the conventions and idioms covered
in the book. But if you ignore all that and just treat it as a nice breakdown
of several great pieces of literature by someone who loves the language, it is
enjoyable.
