# We Are Our Brains

Notes taken while reading the excellent *We are our brains* by Dick Shwaab.

## Hormones

-   Oxytocin - comfort , bonding
-   Prolactin - in expectant fathers. Nesting behaviour in moms.
-   Vasopressin - marital difficulties and aggression in men, but
    trust of strangers in women. Hormone created and released by the
    brain. Also inhibits excretion of water.
-   Both vasopressin and oxytocin levels are unbalanced in autists

### Other

-   Anencephaly linked to pesticide use
-   Thalidomide taken during pregnancy led to birth defects (missing limbs)

## Pain in a fetus

-   Pain sensors on skin - 7th week onwards
-   BUT wiring to cerebral cortex - 26 weeks onwards
-   So the fetus can react locally after 7 weeks but it is doubtful that
    pain is actually transmitted until about 25-29 weeks
-   Finally it must be perceived by the brain. Only at 35-37 weeks is
    there slight difference in reaction to a touch vs a pin prick

## Puberty

-   Young people have a poor PFC i.e. pre frontal cortex , which limits
    their planning and organisational skills
-   Puberty kicks in annoying behaviour within the family to limit
    incest, at the same time increasing risk taking and exploration.
-   The kiss1 gene starts the whole process. Fat reserves are ensured by
    monitoring leptin. Melatonin inhibits puberty.

## Miscellaneous

-   Narcolepsy - sleep disorder. Tiredness in day, uneasy sleep at
    night.
-   Cataplexy - too much emotion leads to patient seemingly becoming
    unconscious. They lose muscle tension and collapse but are fully
    aware otherwise.
