### The Secret History, by Donna Tartt

A dark, fascinating novel about a group of elite students obsessed with ancient
Greek language, philosophy and ritual.  The narrator, like Gatsby's Nick
Carraway, serves as the outsider's view into the lives of these secretive
wealthy students and their brooding leader.
