### Lord of Light, by Roger Zelazny

An enjoyable speculative sci-fi tale of a far future where an advanced group has solved
re-incarnation and elevated themselves to godhood, styling themselves after the Hindu Gods.
They govern humanity by controlling thir karmic cycle and offering godhood as a faraway boon.
Their reign is challenged by one of their own, who has a promethean desire to accelerate
it to the masses.

### What We Can Know, by Ian McEwan

Midway through the book I was not sure if I should keep going, and if this was my kind of 
fiction. But I'm glad I stuck with it. In the near future, a historian looks at an 'Immortal
Lunch' hosted by a poet, that contained the only known rendition of a lost poem. A 
thoughtful look at how history remembers its heroes.
