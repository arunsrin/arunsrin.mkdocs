*Full Title*: Hate Inc.: Why Today's Media Makes Us Despise One Another

*Author*: Matt Taibbi

I've been reading Taibbi for a while now and this was a nice
refreshing step back from his usual acerbic style. He covers the media
industry's complicity in creating a toxic political
environment. Towards the end is where the book gets really
interesting: as an inward-looking view into how the left-leaning media
is as bad in creating filter bubbles as the usual suspects in the
right.


Here are some snippets I saved from the book.

### On Facebook's curation of news

> *Chomsky*: Take a look at the Facebook phenomenon. Where are they
> getting their news from? They don’t have reports.

> They’re just getting it from the New York Times, so it’s the same
> sources of information. They’re just putting it out in trivialized
> form, so that people with a ten- year-old mentality can handle
> it. It’s a very dangerous thing. They’re not doing any of the things
> that the media do. They don’t frame things. They don’t select. They
> don’t send reporters out. They don’t investigate, you know, they
> just collect information and hand it over to kids to look at in ten
> minutes so you don’t believe the newspapers.

### Red flags to look out for

Tricks used by the government to feed news via allied countries:

> This is one reason to always have ears up when you start hearing
> bits and pieces of important intelligence cases happen to have been
> uncovered within the borders of America’s closest intelligence
> allies, particularly England, Australia, the other “Five Eyes”
> nations, and key NATO members.

Regarding unnamed Ferguson sources:

> What is the purpose of the anonymity? Is it to protect someone’s job
> or freedom? Or to insulate the person against political consequence
> if the story goes sideways?

Who initiates the communication?

> Incidentally: it’s a red flag if the call is coming from the
> official, as opposed to the reporter calling the officials. The
> average intelligence official wouldn’t stop to tell you if your
> child was on fire. When they start cold-calling agencies, and/or
> rotating scoops by doling them out to different outlets and papers
> each week, that’s a huge red flag.

Journalist histories:

> When you see one of these stories, check to see if that reporter has
> a history of national security pieces. If he or she does not, if
> this transmission of classified scoops is taking place in the
> context of a new relationship, be extra wary.

### U.S. Wars

> In addition to actions in Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia, Libya,
> and Niger, we’d been aiding the Saudi bombing of Yemen for nearly
> 1,100 consecutive days on December 11, 2017, when the Pentagon
> submitted its latest “where the hell we’re currently at war”
> summary—also known as a section 1264 report, which has to be
> delivered to Congress every six months under the National Defense
> Authorization Act.
