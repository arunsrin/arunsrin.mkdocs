# 📝 Flow

I've long been interested in Active vs Passive hobbies, why one is better than
the others, and so on. Here's a [nice reddit
post](https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/en9li9/if_i_am_genuinely_happy_what_is_wrong_with/)
that captures a similar mindset around gaming. So reading Flow gave a lot of
clarity to these ideas.

Any programmer who's been 'in the zone' and loses sense of time knows the
feeling of 'Flow' and that is the subject of this book -- Deep hobbies that
improve one's self.

The author categorizes activities with good 'flow' if they meet these criteria:

- A challenging activity that requires skills
- Requires concentration
- Has clear goals and immediate feedback
- Removes awareness of everyday frustrations
- Exercises control over ones own actions
- Concern for self disappears
- Sense of time altered

Here are some sections from the book that caught my attention:

> "The wisdom of the mystics, of the Sufi, of the great yogis, or of the Zen
> masters might have been excellent in their own time -- and might still be the
> best, if we lived in those times and in those cultures. But when transplanted
> to contemporary California those systems lose quite a bit of their original
> power. They contain elements that are specific to their original contexts, and
> when these accidental components are not distinguished from what is essential,
> the path to freedom gets overgrown by brambles of meaningless mumbo-jumbo.
> Ritual form wins over substance, and the seeker is back where he started."


> "Pleasure is an important component of the quality of life, but by itself it
> does not bring happiness. Sleep, rest, food, and sex provide restorative
> _homeostatic_ experiences that return consciousness to order after the needs
> of the body intrude and cause psychic entropy to occur. But they do not
> produce psychological growth. They do not add complexity to the self. Pleasure
> helps to maintain order, but by itself cannot create new order in
> consciousness."


> "In today's world we have come to neglect the habit of writing because so many
> other media of communication have taken its place. Telephones and tape
> recorders, computers and fax machines are more efficient in conveying news. If
> the only point of writing were to _transmit_ information, then it would
> deserve to become obsolete. But the point of writing is to _create_
> information, not simply to pass it along."

The middle quote is a satisfactory answer to my question on what differentiates
mindless passive hobbies from effort-intensive active ones: the latter create
better versions of ourselves.
