# Immune, by Phillip Dettmer

This is an incredible book and the brief notes I took below do not do justice
to how well it is written.

White blood cells is a too vague a term for the varied kinds of defenses we
have.. Too simplistic. 

 

## Innate Immune System 

- First line of defense 
- Can differentiate Self vs other. Anything that is not Self is a threat 
- Simple blueprints for vast patterns of attacks (all bacteria for example) 
- Activates the 2nd line of defense if needed 

Important players:

- Macrophage - Think of them as giant tanks: they engulf their prey and break
them down.
will come and rip cells to pieces.
- Dendritic cell - These have tentacles to probe what is going on, and pick up
critical bits of information and send it all the way to the thymus where the
Adaptive Immune system analyzes the signatures and prepares targeted attacks.
- Neutrophil - explodes and spills acid everywhere (?)
- Complement - like a piece of puzzle, they will match with a pathogen and identify it, and travel to the adaptive system to give that information.
- Basophil - causes inflammation, what else?
- Eosinophil - related to allergies I think
- Mast cell - forgot this one
- Natural killer cell - this is trained to kill pathogens and infected cells
but unlike T cells I think they are already trained and ready to deploy (?)

## Adaptive Immune System 

- Blank slate, filled up over a person's lifetime 
- Targeted attacks, like a large encyclopaedia containing every possible threat 

- T cell - this is trained to kill infected cells. It looks at an MCT 'window'
on each cell to see what kind of proteins it is making.. and if the signature
doesn't match, it tells that cell to kill itself.
- B cell - produces antibodies which are these like these really tiny spikes
that rip apart pathogens.
- Antibodies - really tiny spikes that rip apart pathogens.

## Skin

Constantly created and pushed upwards. Then there is a spiky layer of
'defensins' which can rip holes in specific targets like bacteria and fungi.


Upper layers are all dead cells, so not hospitable for viruses. An acid (and
salty layer) above it, which is again very corrosive.  

pH – Power of Hydrogen – each -1 implies 10x more hydrogen I.e acidic. Similarly high pH I.e. alkaline means there is 10x less hydrogen ions. Both less and more pH are corrosive to life.

## The Immune System

Things that 'boost' the immune system: nothing really, boosting is bad if
you've read this book .. The immune system will turn on the body and needs to
be carefully regulated and released only during serious attacks.

So a healthy diet (incl fiber) is all you need. For preventing allergies it
appears that breast milk, natural deliveries and a farm-like upbringing
(cows/dogs running around) make a difference.

On the other hand, things that weaken or suppress your immune system: stress!
smoking.

Apoptosis - cells neatly kill themselves in a self recycling manner. Killer
cells do their job by sending a signal to infected cells to do this. They look
through a 'window' to see what kind of proteins these cells are building. If
they see the bad kind e.g. Viruses, they tell the cell to self destruct.
