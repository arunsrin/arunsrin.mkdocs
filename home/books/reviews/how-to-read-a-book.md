# 📝 How To Read A Book
## By Mortimer J. Adler and Charles Van Doren

Reading this was a turning point for me. For a lifetime, I'd read
anything that caught my interest: science fiction, evolutionary
biology, classic literature and so on.

After reading far too many general science books, I started to realize
that I'd hit a plateau, and was not learning anything new from them. I
felt like I had to go deeper and analyze one of these subjects
thoroughly, or wider, to learn something new.

And then I came across this book. *How to Read a Book* taught me to
embrace difficult books. Life's too short, so why waste it reading
trivial crap? It's better to go straight to the source and read the
thoughts of our greatest thinkers the way they intended.

## Quotes
Here are some quotes from the book that I noted in my reading:

> "Good books are over your head; they would not be good for you if
  they were not."
