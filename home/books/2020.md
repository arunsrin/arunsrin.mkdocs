#### Bottle of Lies, by Katherine Eban

The story of Ranbaxy and the generic drug market. Wasn't what I expected, and
was pleasantly surprised by how nicely the stories were woven together.

#### Olive Kitteridge, by Elizabeth Strout

Not the sort of book I usually read, but Penn Jillete spoke highly of it in
[his podcast](https://pennsundayschool.com/). Well-written, poignant stories of
old age, depression, families and so on, centered around an outspoken, strict
school teacher.

#### The Song of Achilles by Madeline Miller

I found the initial half to be a bit slow-paced, and didn't think the characters were interesting either. But it picked up in the second half and became genuinely interesting. Recommended for fans of Greek mythology.
