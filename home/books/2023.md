### Far From The Madding Crowd, by Thomas Hardy

I have read Tess of the d'Ubervilles and liked it. This one is quite good too.
Recommended.

### Rationality, by Steven Pinker

A dissapointing book. I expected a lot more from the author of *How the mind
works*. Most of the chapters here will be familiar to people who've read about
game theory, statistics, the replication crisis and so on... there are dozens
of general science books that cover this quite well. What could have been a
really interesting chapter on irrationality today (anti vaxxers, tribalist
politics) did not unearth any compelling insights.

The author's primary argument against irrationality is that anyone who argues
in favour of it is doing so on a rational basis, so it is ultimately rational.
Quite unsatisfying.

### The Time Traveler's Almanac, by Ann & Jeff VanderMeer

The book's aim is to be comprehensive collection of time travel short stories.
I would have preferred if it had been half the size with a selection of the
best ones. Nevertheless this is obviously a good collection.
