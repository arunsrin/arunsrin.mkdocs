## January

A great way to start the year. I'm in Chennai and had nothing to do except read.

#### Pride and Prejudice, by Jane Austen

This is my first Austen. I tried to place close attention to the conversations
and motivations of the characters, and imagine how a less skilled author would
have done the same thing.

#### The Witcher Series, by Andrzej Sapkowski

- The Lady of the Lake
- Season of Storms

With these two, I've now read all the Witcher books. The Lady of the Lake was quite exquisite. The
entire series was leading up to this one as all the stories converge to a set of brutal, poignant
and unpredictable set of events. Highly recommended.

The Season of Storms is an unrelated prequel that can be read by itself but has some spoilers about
events in the last book.

#### Ilium, Dan Simmons

It's the Iliad, but with post-human Shakespeare-reading robots, meddling 'gods' and a human society
that has lost all knowledge of its past. If that sounded fun, this book is for you. I tried to go in
blind and enjoyed this. Unfortunately the story doesn't end here and there's one more book that
continues (and hopefully concludes) things.

#### Nausea, Jean-Paul Sartre

A gloomy book about a lonely writer pondering his existence. Quite nice.
