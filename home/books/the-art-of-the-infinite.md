# The Art of the Infinite

This is the kind of book I wish Iâ€™d read 20 years back.

The Kaplans cover a lot of ground, so the book is densely packed with
remarkable insights. Although most of the topics (algebra, geometry)
were covered in my school syllabus in my younger days, the difference
is in how it bridges vast areas of mathematics together.

A seemingly insurmountable problem is shown first. Then some
remarkable piece of magic happens. And the clouds clear and light
shines through.

A book like this gives a glimpse of the awe-inspiring structure and
symmetry in the Universe that mathematicians create in their minds.
