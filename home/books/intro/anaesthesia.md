# Suspended Animation: Concepts of Anaesthesia

In the mid-19th century, the term *etherization* was used to describe
the state produced by the inhalation of ether vapour. They found
chloroform and other agents were more effective. So the term
anaesthesia, i.e. *without sensation*, came into being.

The ether/chloroform combo was not enough and intravenous agents,
muscle relaxants and other adjuncts were introduced. Nowadays an
anaesthetic agent, an analgesic, and a muscle relaxant are used
together.

The author's friend suffered a disclocated shoulder. While fixing it
he was dosed with the analgesic Morphine, and Midazolam which causes
transient memory loss. So the memory of a painful procedure was
forgotten. Is this ethical? The author feels that the deliberate
infliction of pain is not ethical, even if the subsequent memory is
lost.

The conscious mind forms both experiences (e.g. pain) and memories of
those experiences. General anaesthesia temporarily suspends the
formation of both.
