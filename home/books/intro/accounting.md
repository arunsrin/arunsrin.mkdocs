# ðŸ“ƒ Accounting
# Introduction

Apparently, the need to keep accounting was a key driver in the
invention of writing and numbers.

## Types of Accounting

- Book keeping - raw data collection. Almost always double-entry
bookkeeping
- Financial accounting - Create reports about income statement,
balance sheet, etc to see cash flows and profit and financial
positiion of an entity.
- Auditing - Independent checks
- Management accounting - Internal use of accounting data to make
decisions around prices, volumes of production, locations for
expansion etc.

Deloitte, Ernst and Young, KPMG, PwC are apparently the big four.

## Ownership

- Individual / Sole Trader - Fully liable for tax, debt, profit etc.
- Joint Owners / Partners - All partners are legally responsible for
assets, tax etc.
- LLP - partial protection for partners from some liabilities.
- Company - full legal separation of owners from the business.
Company has its own existence and ownership is determined by
'shares'. The 'shareholder' can transfer ownership by selling
shares.


Multinational companies, e.g. Nokia have a single Parent company
that pays taxes, transacts business etc and is viewed as a legal
entity. It has multiple subsidiaries in different countries. Each S
is a legal entity that pays taxes locally and reports dividends
upstream to P.


## International Evolution of Accounting 

Serious accounting (double entry) started in Italy (Luca Pacioli
published a book in 1494 that is the earlier surviving textbook
describing it).

Spread to England eventually in 1800's.

After the Wall Street Crash of 1929, the SEC was formed and
accountability became critical.

With globalization, accounting practices and reporting had to be
similar for comparisons across countries to be valid.

US uses GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles). Australia,
Brazil, Canada and the EU have an IASB (International Accounting
Standards Board) that models the IFRS standards (International
Financial Reporting Standards).

Question: What does India follow?

Answer: IFRS

# The Fundamentals of Financial Accounting

A *Balance Sheet* is officially called *Statement of Financial
Position* by the IFRS.

Good example here, on how initial investment, purchase of
inventories, sale to customer and profit to owner etc are shown in
balance sheet.


## The equation

`Assets0 = Equity0 + Liabilities0`

`Equity1 - Equity0 = Income0->1 - Expenses0->1`

`Assets1 = Equity1 + Liabilities1`

I.e.

`Assets1 = Expenses0->1 = Equity0 + Income0->1 + Liabilities1`

Or

`Assets - Liabilities = Equity = Net Assets`

However, some costs end up as Assets (e.g. Land) or Expenses (e.g.
wages), so it's not always clear which bucket to put a cost into.
Here an asset is a resource which has remaining future benefits at
the period end. An expense is a resource that is used up in that
period. 

So, for example, is money spent on Research and Advertising an Asset
or an Expense?

Approach followed can be to measure Asset (resources with remaining
future benefits at the period end), and call everything else an
Expense.

Or measure all Expenses (everything used up in that period) and tag
everything else as an Asset.

Or mix of both approaches.

## Cash Flow
Some transactions involve cash flowing in or out but no profit (e.g.
buying inventory), while others involve profit but no flow (e.g.
selling inventory with later payment). 

So we represent Operating and Investing and Financing as the 3 cash
flows.

- Operating == buying inventory, paying wages, selling stuff
- Investing == buying property
- Financing == owner investing his money, bank giving loan


*Note* Cash increasing does not imply profit (e.g. it could increase
if we take a loan)

Similarly cash decreasing is also not necessarily bad (e.g. buying
long lasting equipment)

# Financial Reports of Listed Companies

Companies follow GAAP or IFRS and publish annual reports. Here we
will see the audited financial statements.

They will provide:

-  Balance sheet
-  Income statement, in two parts
-  Statement of changes in equity
-  Cash flow statement

## Assets

*Definition*: A resource controlled, as a result of a past
transaction or event, when future benefit is expected.

i.e. a company does not 'control' or 'own' a road, so the road is
not its asset.

It may lease some other company's and use it i.e. it *controls* it.

Staff are not treated as assets because they cannot be 'controlled'.

Assets can be :

-  Tangible: property, plant, equipment
-  Intangible: patents, licenses, software
-  Financial: cash, receivables, shares in other companies,
government bonds.

And they can be:

-  Non-current e.g. property
-  Current e.g. this quarter's sales
This helps assess future cash flows.

An asset is represented in the balance sheet in onese ways:

-  NRV: Net Realizable Value i.e. current selling price
-  FV: Fair Value i.e. market price now.
-  HC: Historical Cost i.e. original cost
-  DCF: Discounted Cash Flows i.e. worth to the business.

Apart from HC, rest are not easy to calculate or not relevant (FV is
useless if there's no plan to sell the asset). So usually its
represented on a cost basis i.e. market price of buying an inventory
+ taxes + transport + storage + labour and materials ==> cost of
that inventory.

Depreciation of asset also needs to be considered. 

> Depreciation = (Cost - Residual Life) / Life

## Liabilities

*Definition*: A present obligation, cause by a past event, expected
to lead to future outflows.

E.g amounts owed to banks, tax authorities etc. Those that are
present.

Therefore future wages are not liabilities.

Things that need to paid in the distant future are adjusted through
discounting to differentiate from more urgent payments.

## Interpreting numbers

Profit alone not enough e.g. measure their sales as well.

Also see their long term debt.

And liquidity i.e. can they meet current obligations with current
assets.

Also how *geared* or *leveraged* are they, i.e. a heavily geated
company is funded by a lot of debt and not equity capital. High gear
== high risk. (since larger loans means more interest etc)

> Earning per share (EPS) = profit after tax / Number of shares
issued

> Price earning (p/e) ratio : Market price per share / Earnings per
share

i.e. expensiveness of the share i.e confidence level of investors.
High p/e ratio => high confidence in the company.

## Misleading accounts

- Window dressing: temporary trans to improve numbers
- Creative accounting: exploit loopholes, lack of clarity
- Off-balance-sheet finance: incur obligations but don't show them

# International Differences and Standardization
IFRS vs GAAP

Daimler-Benz and British Airways published earnings in both models
and showed wildly different profit figures!

---

# Regulation and Audit

Some stuff around the SEC, auditors, etc.

Statements are prepared by directors and auditors cannot prepare or
change them, they only publish a review.

Stages of an audit:
-  Accepting and defining terms of engagement
-  Planning, risk assessment, level of materiality (i.e level of
approximation that is acceptable)
-  Gathering evidence
-  Reporting to client and others

# Internal Decision-making: Costs and Volumes

As a part of financial accounting, the following are produced:
income statement, the balance sheet, the cash flow statement.

^ These are required by law. 

But management accounting (focus of this and next chapter) is around
internal documents: costing reports, break-even reports, budgets.

---

# Accounting as Control 

Stuff around internal Planning, Motivation (bonuseslegation (budget
to each team), Communication, Control (analyze and iterate),
Evaluation.

Come up with a balanced scorecard around 3 axes:

-  Keeping customers happy
-  Having good internal processes/objectives
-  Achieving learning/growth

# Homework

Download and Understand a few financial reports. Compare 2
companies.

- How leveraged is it? i.e. is money going to pay interest (i.e
they've taken loans) or to pay owners
- How much is it borrowing i.e. more borrowing -> more future growth
