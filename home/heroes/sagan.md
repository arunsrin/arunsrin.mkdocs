# ðŸŒŒ Carl Sagan

## Why

Dawkins made me an atheist, but Sagan first had to make me a
sceptic. In my childhood, I used to believe anything I read. I was
obsessed with pseudo-scientific rubbish like ESP and Telepathy and
Aliens in Roswell. It took kind-hearted Sagan's thought-provoking
books to guide me back to a more sensble path.

Carl Sagan was a great explainer and a passionate communicator. Who
better to represent all of humanity, in the plaques that were sent out
to space in the Voyager?
