# ðŸ’­ Noam Chomsky

## Why

I read Chomsky through [this article by Aaron
Swartz](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/epiphany) on the book that
changed his life. So I did what Aaron did, and picked up
*Understanding Power*. Everything about that book is as crushingly
world-changing as he describes.

Considering his subject material and how challenging it must be to
communicate his world-view to others, he does a phenomenal job of
it. He never raises his voice, resorts to ad-hominems, or loses his
calm.

## Recommended reading

Chomsky has lived a long and productive life as a linguist, historian,
and activist. If you're the type who underlines important bits in a
book, chances are you'll end up underlining almost every line in his
books. Among the ones I've read, I recommend the following:

- *Understanding Power*
- *The Essential Chomsky*
