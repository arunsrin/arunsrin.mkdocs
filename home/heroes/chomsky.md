# Noam Chomsky

## Why

I read Chomsky through [this article by Aaron
Swartz](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/epiphany) on the book that
changed his life. So I did what Aaron did, and picked up
*Understanding Power*. Everything about that book is as crushingly
world-changing as he describes.

Conspiracy theorists are stupid. Dark, dystopian dreams of
corporations and Military Industrial Complexes running the world are
good material for story books. But the world Chomsky opens your eyes
to is in a way, worse. He lifts the veils on atrocities that have been
happening over the past few decades, meticulously referenced with
proof after bitter proof.

Considering his subject material and how challenging it must be to
communicate his world-view to others, he does a phenomenal job of
it. He never raises his voice, resorts to ad-hominems, or loses his
calm.

## Recommended reading

Chomsky has lived a long and productive life as a linguist, historian,
and activist. If you're the type who underlines important bits in a
book, chances are you'll end up underlining almost every line in his
books. Among the ones I've read, I recommend the following:

- *Understanding Power*
- *The Essential Chomsky*
