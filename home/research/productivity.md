# âœ… Productivity

## Summary

I've tried a crapload of tools for tasks, notes, bookmarking, scheduling and
what not. I realize I was more interested in trying new things than in really
'maximizing' my 'productivity'.

These days I'm in a high-stress job involving a lot of churn and
unpredictability, and I've found that checklists are /very/ useful and MS ToDo
is a decent enough app to settle down with.

Bookmarks are overrated.

Note taking is, at least for me, an obsessive habit
and immensely useful at work but fairly useless for personal goals.

## Tools

I like and highly recommend the following tools:

- MS To Do - this has an indispensable feature called 'Plan My Day' which is
the first thing I do every morning. Makes it quite easy to surface things that
you had scheduled for a particular day. Cross Platform, so it's really easy to
add and review periodically.

- OneNote - After using text-based editors for years, I've taken a liking to
tools that support images. OneNote does this well with a great interface, 3
levels of 'folder' hierarchy and great integration with my stylus. I pretty
much use this as a whiteboarding app these days and nothing much else.

- [Vim](../notes/editors.md) / [Typora](https://typora.io/) - I'm torn between
markdown as a store of data and OneNote. Typora seems to bridge both worlds
with a really nice UI and seamless integration for images. I use this at work
for taking notes, documenting what I did each day, and so on.
