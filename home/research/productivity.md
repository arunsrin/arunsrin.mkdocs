## Hobby Planning

Once a week I have a 'Planning' session. I skim through my To Dos, what I did this week and what I want to do the next week. This is purely for my personal hobbies and not for work. For example, on one week I might binge-watch a TV show that just came out, so the next week I try to spend more time reading. In this slot, I also skim through my long-term hobby goals, and see what medium / short term steps I'm taking towards reaching them.

Right now I like to balance my team between [reading](../books/index.md) and [playing games](../games/xbox.md). 

Art is something I want to get better at so I try to do something there as well.

## Tools

I like and highly recommend the following tools:

- MS To Do - this has an indispensable feature called 'Plan My Day' which is the first thing I do every morning. Makes it quite easy to surface things that you had scheduled for a particular day. Cross Platform, so it's really easy to add and review periodically.
- OneNote - After using text-based editors for years, I've taken a liking to tools that support images. OneNote does this well with a great interface, 3 levels of 'folder' hierarchy and great integration with my stylus.
- [Vim](../notes/editors.md) / [Typora](https://typora.io/) - I'm torn between markdown as a store of data and OneNote. Typora seems to bridge both worlds with a really nice UI and seamless integration for images.
