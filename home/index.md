Welcome to my home page.

### What's here

Commonly used commands are burned in my memory, but the less common
ones (e.g. during bring up of a new box) are a pain to search for each
time.

So here are notes I've collected over time on various things that
interest me.

#### Tech Snippets

One-liners for a variety of tools I use regularly.. Linux, openssl and
so on.

#### Book Notes

trying to take notes for some books that are worthy of revisits.
