# 🏡 Home

Welcome to my home page.

## ⬇️What's here

I read a lot of [books](books/index.md) but want to turn that into a
more active hobby that ties into writing in some way. So you will find
a list of books I've read, and reviews of some of them.

On the software side, I've collected some notes over time on various
things that interest me. They're not burned in my memory like the
Emacs/readline keybindings, so I've felt the need to dump them here.

## 🐧About

See [About](about.md) for more about me. This site is built using the
lovely [MkDocs](http://www.mkdocs.org), a python-based static site
generator. The content is written in markdown using GNU Emacs. It is
hosted on [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com/).

## 🌐External Links

- ☠️[My Blog](https://arunsrin.wordpress.com) - I double commit my
  content here too because there's times when I liked wordpress (I can
  post my artwork there) and times when I like this mkdocs site.
  Structurally I like the garden-like feel of this site more than
  chronological format of a blog). Abandoned, at this point.

- ☠️[Asha's blog](https://pinkwedelia.wordpress.com) - My daughter's
wordpress blog. She writes all the content, I just help with uploading
images and post tagging/cateogorization.

- ☠️[Siddharth's blog](https://astrogrug.wordpress.com) - My son's
wordpress. I help him with choosing titles and uploading pics, he
figures out the rest.

- Books I own, on
  [LibraryThing](https://www.librarything.com/catalog/indeliblestamp)
  and
  [GoodReads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/103052357-arun-s).

- [Github Profile](https://github.com/arunsrin/) - Mostly this site
  and my dotfiles.

- ☠️[My Steam Profile](https://steamcommunity.com/id/indeliblestamp) - Not used much.

- [My TrueAchievements
Profile](https://www.trueachievements.com/gamer/arunsrin) - I'm not an
achievement hunter but it tracks my Xbox progress quite well.
