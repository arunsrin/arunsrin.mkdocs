Welcome to my home page.

## What's here

I read a lot of books but want to turn that into a more active hobby that ties
into writing in some way. So you will find a list of books I've read, and
reviews of some of them.

On the software side, I've collected some notes over time on various things that
interest me. They're not burned in my memory like the Emacs/readline
keybindings, so I've felt the need to dump them here.

### Book Notes

Here is a list of books read per year, starting November 2019.

- [2020](books/2020.md)

trying to take notes for some books that are worthy of revisits.
