# 🔍 Elastic Stack

These are notes from *Learning Elastic Stack 7.0*, by Pranav Shukla
and Sharath Kumar MN.

## Using the Kibana Console

Some simple APIs to warm up.

- `GET /` <- Prints version information
- `GET <index-name>/_mappings` <- schema/mappings of this index
- `GET <index-name>/_doc/<id_of_document>` <- Content of this document

# Fundamentals

An `Index` is loosely analogous to a table, and a document to a
record.  One Index can have only one `Type`.

`Types` are logical groupings same/similar documents in an
`Index`. e.g.  Employees could be one Type and Orders could be
another, even if both were json documents and both had several common
fields.

`Documents`: basic unit of information. Contains multiple fields like
date, logMessage, processName, etc. Internal fields that Elastic
itself maintains: `_id` (unique identifier), `_type` (Document's type,
e.g. _doc), `_index` (Index name where it is stored)

`Nodes` form together to form a `cluster`.

## Shards and Replicas

One can shard an index so that it is split into multiple segments,
which will then reside on 1 or more nodes. By default 5 shards are
made for every index. But if a node were to go down, those shards
would be lost. So you can also create one replica for each shard,
which will again be distributed in a slightly different order on the
same nodes. Execution of queries is transparently distribute to either
the primary or the replica shards.

## Core DataTypes

- String datatypes: 
	- `text` - general lengthy text, elastic can do full-text search on this
	- `keyword` - let's you run some analytics on string fields, i.e. something you want to sort, filter, aggregate
- Numeric datatypes:
	- `byte`/`short`/`integer`/`long`
	- `float`/`double`
	- `half_float`
	- `scaled_float`
- `date` datatype
- `boolean` datatype
- `binary` datatype - arbitrary binary content, base64-encoded
- Range datatypes: `integer_range`, `float_range`, `long_range`, `double_range`, `date_range`

## Complex DataTypes
- `array` - no mixing, list of same types
- `object` - allows inner objects within json documents
- `nested` - arrays of inner objects, where each inner object needs to be independently queriable

## Other DataTypes
- `geo-point` datatype - stores geo-points as lat and long
- `geo-shape` datatype - store geometric shapes like polygons, maps, etc. Allows queries that search within a shape
- `ip` datatype - ipv4/ipv6

## Indexes

Check `GET <index-name>/_mappings` in the dev console to see the
fields and their types in this index.

You will see stuff like this:

```json
        "file" : {
          "type" : "text",
          "fields" : {
            "keyword" : {
              "type" : "keyword",
              "ignore_above" : 256
            }
          }
        },
```

What this means is, `file` is a field of type `text`, but it's also
mapped as a `keyword` so you can also do analytics on it.

An *Inverted Index* is built from all fields.

## CRUD APIs

An *indexing operation* is basically the addition of a document to the
index. Elastic parses all the fields and builds the inverted index.

Use the `PUT` API to do this, with or without an id.

Get it with this:

`GET <index-name>/_doc/<id of document>`

You can call an `UPDATE` with just a specific field (say, `price`) to
update that field in the document. Elastic will version and maintain
both copies. The `_version` field will be incremented.

You can set the field `doc_as_upsert` to `true` and call a POST to
`<index>/_update/<id>` to update if it exists or insert otherwise.

You can even do some scripting when you call the POST, using Elastic's
'painless' scripting language. e.g. to increment current value by 2.

`DELETE`: Call it on `<index>/_doc/<id>` as expected.

## Updating a mapping

In this example, the 'code' field is converted to a `keyword` type:

```json
PUT /catalog/_mapping
{
  "properties": {
    "code": {
      "type": "keyword"
    }
  }
}
```

# REST API overview

Main categories:

- Document APIs
- Search APIs
- Aggregation APIs
- Indexes APIs
- Cluster APIs
- cat APIs

For pretty printing while using curl, suffix `?pretty=true`. In the
Console UI, it's turned on by default.

## Searching

Use the `_search` API: 

```
GET /_search
```

This prints ALL docs in ALL indexes, first 10 results only though.


To search within an index:

```json
GET /<index-name>/_search
GET /<index-name>/_doc/_search
```

In earlier versions of elastic, an index could have more than one
type. In the above example, `_doc` is the type.

In Elastic 7.0, only one type is supported. So the second GET is
deprecated.

To search across more than one index:

```json
GET /catalog,my_index/_search
```

# Analytics and Visualizing Data

Elastic has *Analyzers* that break down values of a field into terms,
to make it searchable. This happens both during indexing and during
searching. Final goal is for the searchable index to be created.

Analyzers comprise of Character Filters, a Tokenizer, and Token
Filters.

*Character filters* map strings to something else, e.g. :) maps to
*_smile_*. They are run at the beginning of the processing chain in an
analyzer.

*Token Filters* are used for use cases like, removing stop words
(a/an/the), replacing everything to lowercase, etc.

Apart from the (default) Standard Analyzer, there are [many
others](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/analysis-analyzers.html).

To understand how the tokenization happens, here's an example:

```json
GET /_analyze
{
  "text" : "test analysis",
  "analyzer": "standard"
}
```

Output:

```json
{
  "tokens" : [
    {
      "token" : "test",
      "start_offset" : 0,
      "end_offset" : 4,
      "type" : "<ALPHANUM>",
      "position" : 0
    },
    {
      "token" : "analysis",
      "start_offset" : 5,
      "end_offset" : 13,
      "type" : "<ALPHANUM>",
      "position" : 1
    }
  ]
}
```

With different analyzers and filters, the final tokens would be
different.

## Term queries

You would use these in a search query to bypass the analysis stage and
directly lookup the inverted index. Other more complex queries use
these as a base.

Types of term queries:

- `range` query - e.g. to show all Products where the Price attibute
is >10 and <=20.
	- You can boost the weight of the results by suppplying a `boost`
      multipler.
	- You can query date ranges e.g. from `now-7d` to `now`.
- `exists` query - Just tell if the field exists or not.
- Term query - e.g do an exact match for a certain manufacturer in a
  Product index. Use the `keyword` type for this since keywords are
  not indexed. 
	  - You can get the keyword by querying `<fieldname>.raw`
- Terms query - Same as above, but you can give multiple terms to
  search for.
  
And a few others, see the full list of
[term-levelqueries](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/term-level-queries.html)
here.
  
`match` queries do the actual full-text searching. However if you
search in a keyword (like `datacenter.raw` which is a keyword field),
it skips all that and does an exact match.

You can set params for `fuzziness` in your search and it will return
results accordingly e.g. victer will match with victor.

## Bucket aggregations

Like a GROUP BY basically. Example:

```json
GET <index_name>/_search
{
	"aggs" {
		"byCategory": {
			"terms": {
				"field": "category"
			}
		}
	},
	"size": 0
}
```

- The size is set to 0 so we don't get raw results, but only
  the aggregated ones.
  
You can also bucketize by numerical ranges, e.g. show me everything
between 1 and 100, 100 and 1000, etc.

## Metric aggregations

Like doing a COUNT or AVG etc on numeric data. It's all json instead
of SQL. Example:

```json
GET <index_name>/_search
{
	"aggregations": {
		"download_max" : {
			"max": {
				"field": "downloadTotal"
			}
		}
	},
	"size": 0
}
```

A Stats aggregation is similar but it basically does the sum, average,
mix, max and count in a single shot.

## Buckets based on Geospatial data

- Geodistance aggregation - based on a lat/long, query hits within a
  certain radius.
- GeoHash grid aggregation - Divides the map into grids and searches
  within a wide imprecise grid or narrower, more precise grids.

# Logstash

I already know this quite well. Input/Filter/Output sections etc.

## Input Plugins

- `file` is the most obvious, to read from a file.
- `beats` tells logstash to pull from a beats daemon. Just takes a
  `port` setting and nothing else.
- `jdbc`: imports from a database. Each row becomes an event, each
  column becomes a field. You can specify your sql statement and how
  often to query.
- `imap`: read mails!

## Output Plugins

- `elasticsearch`, and `kafka` obviously.
- `csv`
- `pagerduty` to send to PD. e.g. your input plugin could match all
  5xx errors and output could directly page someone.

## Filter Plugins

`grok` is the one I've used most but there are others.

- `csv` - Tell it to `autodetect_columns` otherwise set yours
  explicitly, and it will extract csv data.
- `mutate` - You can `convert` fields here (Age to integer), `rename`
  them (FName to FirstName), `strip` them, `uppercase` them,
  etc. Looks quite powerful
- `grok` - most poweful. match a line against an expression. Use
  `%{PATTERN:FIELDNAME:type}` to match a pattern with a field and set
  its type. Some in-built patterns are `TIMERSTAMP_ISO8601`,
  `USERNAME`, `GREEDYDATA`. A nice list is
  [here](https://grokdebug.herokuapp.com/patterns#).
- `date` - You can set a pattern like `dd/MMM/YYY:HH:mm:ss Z` as your
  case may be. Overrides the `@timestamp` field by default.
- `geoip` - converts an ip to a geoip json (timezone, lat/long,
  continent code, country name and code etc.)
- `useragent` - converts a UA string based on Browserscope data, to
  OS, browser, version fields.

## Codec Plugins

There are also 'codec' plugins to encode/decode events: these are hit
just before the input stage, or just before it leaves the output
stage. Examples:

- `json`: treats data as json, otherwise falls back to plain text and
  adds a `_jsonparsefailure` tag.
- `rubydebug` for ruby stuff
- `multiline` for merging multiple lines into a single event, think a
  long backtrace. You can specify a regex e.g. any line that starts
  with a space `"^\s "`, and logstash will merge it with the previous
  event.

# Elastic Pipelines

Newer elastic versions have an 'ingest node', if you use this you can
potentially skip all the filtering in logstash. These nodes can do the
preprocessing before the indexing happens.

You would define a pipeline, with a series of processors. Each
processor transforms the document in some way.

Some processors: gsub, grok, convert, remove, rename, etc. [Full list
of processor
directives](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/processors.html).

e.g. I've seen `dissect` used to do basically what `grok` does.

You would use the `_ingest` API to play with pipelines.

# Beats

Lightweight shippers. A library called `libbeat` is used. Go is used
so a single fat binary is all you need. Looks like this does the input
and output part of logstash, and pipelines do the filter part.

- `filebeat` - takes files and sends them to elastic, kafka, logstash,
  etc.
    - You can use an out of the box module, consisting of path to look
    for logs, elastic Ingest pipeline to send to, elastic templates
    contianing field definitions, and sample kibana dashboards.
- `metricbeat` - like collectd.
- `packetbeat` - real time packet analyzer, understands Application
  layer like HTTP, MySQL, Redis etc.
- `heartbeat` - check if service is up and reachable. Supports icmp,
  tcp, http probes.
- `winlogbeat` - Reads event logs using windows APIs.
- `auditbeat` - Skips auditd and directly communicates with underling
  audit framework apparently.
- `journalbeat` - For journald.
- `functionbeat` - For serverless.

3rd party stuff: spring, nginx, mysql, mongo, apache, docker, kafka,
redis, kafka, amazon*. Full list
[here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/devguide/current/community-beats.html).


# Kibana Notes

## Initial Setup

You must first create an index-pattern that aggregates your
indexes. Then you would see all its fields, and can make each of them
searchable, aggregatable, etc.

## Queries

Recollect the Term Queries section above. You can search for all those
exact matches with `field:value`, e.g. `datacenter:sjc`.

OOh you can also do wildcard searches, like this: `host:nginx*` will
match all host fields with the value nginx01, nginx02, etc.

MUST NOT is like this: `~response:200`

Ranges are like this: `response:[301 to 500]`

## KQL

[KQL Guide](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/7.15/kuery-query.html)

Example: `response:200 or geoip.city_name:Diedorf`

## Visualizations

Kibana supports these 2 aggregations:
- Bucket: like a GROUP BY.
- Metric: you can plot Count, Average, Sum, Min, Max, Standard Deviation, etc.

# X-Pack

You'd see stuff like this on the sidebar: Maps, Machine Learning,
Infrastructure, Logs, APM, Uptime, Dev Tools, Stack Monitoring.
