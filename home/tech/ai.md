I'm enjoying playing with LLMs these days. Here are some ways it has improved my life:

- The random quotes at the bottom of this (and all other) pages is generated by a simple bit of javascript that chatgpt helped create. It knew how to integrate this into mkdocs, and generated a bunch of quotes too :) 

- The 'Summarize this page' button on each page talks to the chatgpt API and returns a brief summary. Again, I asked chatgpt to help design the whole flow using Cloudflare workers.


## Hosting

I now have an [openwebui](https://openwebui.com/) instance running on a cheap
[ovh](https://ovhcloud.com/) VM. The steps were really trivial, and overall
this appears to be a cheaper/better alternative to chatgpt pro.

Here is the link: https://chat.arunsr.in/ (I have a login and I do not plan to
open this up for anyone else)
