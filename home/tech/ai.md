## Pros

I'm enjoying playing with LLMs these days. Here are some ways it has improved
my life:

- The random quotes at the bottom of this (and all other) pages is
  generated by a simple bit of javascript that chatgpt helped
  create. It knew how to integrate this into mkdocs, and generated a
  bunch of quotes too :)

- Planning my hobbies: roadmap for how to enjoy chess more, how to draw better
  and so on.

## Cons

As someone who has a lot of respect for the Free Software community and who
also enjoys drawing, it pains me to see how LLMs have scraped and
[stolen](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2025/03/libgen-meta-openai/682093/)
terabytes of content in order to train themselves. The hypocrisy of these
companies is apalling.

Here are some thoughtful links that go deeper:

- [Chomsky on AI](https://chomsky.info/20230503-2/) - His stance is very clear,
  as a scientist it does not have any value for him as it does not model the
  human brain in any way. And he does not care about the engineering aspects.

- [The Hater's Guide to the AI
  Bubble](https://www.wheresyoured.at/the-haters-gui/) - Ed Zitron really hates
  how AI is being hyped and he raises some fair points on the economic
  unsustainability of it all. I'm not an expert here but I suppose time will
  tell if he is right.
