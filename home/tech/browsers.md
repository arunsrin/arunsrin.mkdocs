# üåê Browsers

I've settled on, surprisingly, MS Edge as my primary browser. The bits I like:

- It allows me to have a separate instance signed in with my work profile, and
another one with my personal profile. So I'm quite happy segregating bookmarks,
extensions, etc across both those instances.
- The chrome family of browsers have the best *Print to PDF* option. I use this
once in a while to archive great pages (like LWN's weekly news).

### Great extensions

- [Bitwarden](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/bitwarden-free-password/jbkfoedolllekgbhcbcoahefnbanhhlh): This is my password manager so I can't live without this one.

- [Vimium](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vimium/dbepggeogbaibhgnhhndojpepiihcmeb): If you're a Vi person (I'm an Emacs guy usually), this will make you feel right at home in the browser. There's nothing as peaceful as using j/k to scroll, `f` to highlight links and open them, etc, all from the keyboard.

- ~~[Dark Reader](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/dark-reader/ifoakfbpdcdoeenechcleahebpibofpc): Just turned this on now and my eyes are thanking it already. Dark mode everywhere!~~

- [uBlock Origin](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/ublock-origin/odfafepnkmbhccpbejgmiehpchacaeak): Adblocker of choice. Set it up, forget about it. It's only when I see someone else's browser that I realize how improved my own browsing experience is.

- [Bazqux Reader](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/bazqux-reader-open-links/dfoegpibjpjpchgmjnmomelfnclbijnm): My RSS reader of choice, and this extension simply lets me open links in the background. Good for opening a bunch of tabs early in the morning.

- [Don't Fuck with Paste](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dont-fuck-with-paste/nkgllhigpcljnhoakjkgaieabnkmgdkb): Because some websites think they're being really clever, disabling Paste in the name of security.

- [Enable Right Click](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/enable-right-click/hhojmcideegachlhfgfdhailpfhgknjm): Same as above, for right clicking.

### Firefox: open links in background tab always

-   Open a new tab, enter `about:config`
-   Search for browser.tabs.loadDivertedInBackground
-   Double click on '`false`' to set 'Value' to '`true`'
-   Go to NewsBlur and open a story with 'o' and see it load in the background
