# ☸️ Kubernetes

Some kubernetes overview links, with a focus on networking.

## Terminal Enhancements

### k9s

Get it [here](https://k9scli.io/). My go-to cluster navigator of choice. Very
vim-like in behavior.

### k3s / kind / minikube

For local development:
- **k3s**: Lightweight Kubernetes, great for IoT and Edge but also amazing for local labs.
- **kind**: Run Kubernetes inside Docker. Fast and reliable for CI/CD.

### Cilium and eBPF

Modern Kubernetes networking is moving towards **eBPF** for performance and security. **Cilium** is the leading CNI in this space, replacing traditional iptables-based kube-proxy in many environments.

## Books

- *Kubernetes in Action* by Marko Luksa. (Get the 2nd Edition for updated content).
- *Cloud Native Infrastructure with Azure* (or your cloud of choice).
