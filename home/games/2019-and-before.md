# 🎮 2019 and before

I got my Xbox One in 2018 and it rekindled my love of gaming. Prior
to this I had a few handhelds (Vita and 3DS) and played a bit on my
PC.

The ones with a ♥ are highly recommended.

## Completed

  - Far Cry 4 - Almost as good as 5. Better story as well. I think I like 5 more
    only because I played it first.
  - Shadow of the Tomb Raider - Fun game, great visuals and stealth sections.
    Little disappointed with the overall game. I can't put my hand to exactly
    what felt wrong.
  - ♥**Far Cry 5** - Probably my favourite game on the console so far. Amazing
    open world, supports a lot of play styles, nice co-op AI partners.
  - ♥**Rayman Legends** - My kids love this. Exquisite level design & music.
  - Life is Strange - I felt a little old playing this, but it was worth completing.
  - Gears of War 4 - Like a Michael Bay movie. Fun diversion for a few hours.
  - Batman: Arkham Knight - Disappointing. Too much driving.
  - INSIDE - Lovely little gem of a game.
  - Watch Dogs - Pretty fun game except for the brooding protagonist.
  - ♥**Titanfall 2** - Absolutely phenomenal single-player campaign.
  - ♥**Rise of the Tomb Raider** - Probably my favourite series. I have fond
    memories of playing *Tomb Raider: Legend* on my PS2.
  - Mass Effect: Andromeda - I wish they made more games like this. Phenomenal
    world designs. Sped through the last quarter of the game but what I loved
    most was exploring each planet in the early stages.
  - Bioshock - I'd played it earlier on PC and sped through the first part. Not
    a fan of the choice system, but enjoyable otherwise.
  - Homefront Revolution - Ignore the reviews, this is a fun game. Very nice
    tension where you're initially avoiding an overpowered enemy, and slowly
    instigating enough of a rebellion to tip the balance.
  - Halo 5 - Decent single player campaign. Skipped the multiplayer bits. Had no
    idea what was going on story-wise, as I've never payed a Halo before.
  - Call of Duty - Infinite Warfare - Tolerable single player campaign.
    Titanfall 2 does this kind of thing a lot better.
  - Deus Ex: Mankind Divided - Badly wanted to like this game, but didn't.
