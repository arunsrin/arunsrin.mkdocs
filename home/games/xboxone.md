# Games - Xbox One

I prefer single-player Action Adventure games. I prefer the story-telling
experience over the mastery of the mechanics.

The ones in **bold** below are highly recommended.

## Completed
  
  - Shadow of the Tomb Raider - Fun game, great visuals and stealth sections.
Little disappointed with the overall game. I can't put my hand to exactly what
felt wrong.

  - **Far Cry 5** - Probably my favourite game on the console so far. Amazing
open world, supports a lot of play styles, nice co-op AI partners.
  
  - **Rayman Legends** - My kids love this. Exquisite level design & music.
  
  - Life is Strange - I felt a little old playing this, but it was worth completing.

  - Gears of War 4 - Like a Michael Bay movie. Fun diversion for a few hours.

  - Batman: Arkham Knight - Disappointing. Too much driving.

  - INSIDE - Lovely little gem of a game.

  - Watch Dogs - Pretty fun game except for the brooding protagonist.
  
  - **Titanfall 2** - Absolutely phenomenal single-player campaign.
  
  - **Rise of the Tomb Raider** - Probably my favourite series. I have fond
memories of playing *Tomb Raider: Legend* on my PS2.
  
  - Mass Effect: Andromeda - I wish they made more games like this. Phenomenal
world designs. Sped through the last quarter of the game but what I loved most
was exploring each planet in the early stages.

  - Bioshock - I'd played it earlier on PC and sped through the first part. Not
a fan of the choice system, but enjoyable otherwise.

  - Homefront Revolution - Ignore the reviews, this is a fun game. Very nice
tension where you're initially avoiding an overpowered enemy, and slowly
instigating enough of a rebellion to tip the balance.

  - Halo 5 - Decent single player campaign. Skipped the multiplayer bits. Had
no idea what was going on story-wise, as I've never payed a Halo before.

  - Call of Dury - Infinite Warfare - Tolerable single player campaign.
Titanfall 2 does this kind of thing a lot better.
