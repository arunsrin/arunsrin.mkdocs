# Games - Xbox One

I prefer single-player Action Adventure games. I prefer the story-telling experience over the mastery of the mechanics.

## Completed
  
  - **Far Cry 5** - Probably my favourite game on the console so far. Amazing open world, supports a lot of play styles,
  nice co-op AI partners.
  
  - **Rayman Legends** - My kids love this. Beautiful level design & music.
  
  - Life is Strange
  - Gears of War 4
  - Batman: Arkham Knight
  - INSIDE
  - Watch Dogs
  
  - **Titanfall 2** - Absolutely phenomenal single-player campaign.
  
  - **Rise of the Tomb Raider** - Probably my favourite series. I have fond memories of playing *Tomb Raider: Legend* on
  my PS2.
  
  - Mass Effect: Andromeda
  - Bioshock
