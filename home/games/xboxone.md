# ðŸŽ®Games - Xbox One

I prefer single-player Action Adventure open-world games. Bonus points if it has
a good story.

Since 2018 I've had an Xbox One S.

In late-2021 I got a new laptop and it is great that Game Pass
Ultimate gives you access to a lot of the console portfolio, with
saves sync'd neatly between the two.

Here are the games I've played in the past few years:

- [2019 and before](2019-and-before.md)
