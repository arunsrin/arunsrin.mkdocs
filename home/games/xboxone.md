# Games - Xbox One

I prefer single-player Action Adventure open-world games. Bonus points if it has
a good story.

The ones with a ♥ are highly recommended.

## Completed

  - The Gunk - Another short game that I finished in just over a day. Lovely world design and visuals.
  - Firewatch - A short mystery game with lovely visuals. Finished it in one day.
  - Halo 2 - This was definitely better than the first. Less cut-and-paste
    levels. The story is starting to get quite interesting too..
  - ♥**Halo: Reach** - My favourite Halo so far! Absolutely blew me away, both
    gameplay and story-wise.
  - Halo: CE - With Infinite releasing soon, I thought it would be nice to dip
    my feet into this franchise. The first game feels a bit dated in some ways,
    but was pretty enjoyable overall.
  - Last Stop: Another interactive story. A light, funny science fiction plot
    with 3 intersecting stories.
  - Lost Words: Beyond the Page - A touching story of a child coping with loss
    through stories. Lovely art style and story.
  - Ryse: Son of Rome - Lovely, violent game.
  - The Dark Pictures Anthology: Man Of Medan - A fun horror adventure with 4
    interlocking characters in an abandoned ship. This game kindled my love for
    story-driven experiences.
  - Quantum Break - A  game based on time-travel with alternating filmed
    episodes. A lot of fun!
  - Resident Evil Revelations 2 - Enjoyed this. Looks like it'd be nice as a
    co-op game too. I don't like the survival parts of survival horror much so
    thankfully the easy mode was forgiving.
  - ♥**Darksiders 2** - Had a blast playing this. Lovely world design, fun 
    puzzles, and enough variety to keep thing fresh.
  - Assassin's Creed Origins - Everyone said this was better than Odyssey and
    indeed it is. The side quests are way better and everything feels well
    designed.
  - Diablo 3 - I played in easy mode as a Mage and it was perhaps too easy. So
    I did not feel like playing again with a different characters.
  - Gears 5 - Again, an enjoyable game. Quite different from the classics but
    good in its own way.
  - Gears 2, Gears 3 - Finished the remaining legacy Gears games during the 2020 
    year-end holidays. An excellent series from start to finish.
  - ♥**Gears of War** - Mindless fun. Thoroughly enjoyed playing this and now I
    intend to play through the rest of the series.
  - Rage 2 - I have a soft spot for this series so I liked it.
  - ♥**Assassin's Creed Odyssey** - I've loved greek mythology all my life so
    this was an amazing experience. Very nice variety in play styles
    (ranger/warrior/assassin), and constant loots and upgrades made for a
    addictive gameplay loop. Side quest plots are pretty average.
  - Injustice 2 - Kids loved it. Nice single player campaign, but a bit short.
  - Watch Dogs 2 - It took me several attempts to get into this game. The open
world is beautiful, and so is the satirical take on Silicon Valley. The part I
struggled with was the annoying stealth gameplay. I truly started enjoying it
only after switching my play style to a more aggressive mode.
  - Thief - Enjoyable game. I loved their stealth implementation (over other
    games like Deus Ex: Mankind Divided). There were some truly thrilling
    moments during the game.
  - Far Cry 4 - Almost as good as 5. Better story as well. I think I like 5 more
    only because I played it first.
  - Shadow of the Tomb Raider - Fun game, great visuals and stealth sections.
    Little disappointed with the overall game. I can't put my hand to exactly
    what felt wrong.
  - ♥**Far Cry 5** - Probably my favourite game on the console so far. Amazing
    open world, supports a lot of play styles, nice co-op AI partners.
  - ♥**Rayman Legends** - My kids love this. Exquisite level design & music.
  - Life is Strange - I felt a little old playing this, but it was worth completing.
  - Gears of War 4 - Like a Michael Bay movie. Fun diversion for a few hours.
  - Batman: Arkham Knight - Disappointing. Too much driving.
  - INSIDE - Lovely little gem of a game.
  - Watch Dogs - Pretty fun game except for the brooding protagonist.
  - ♥**Titanfall 2** - Absolutely phenomenal single-player campaign.
  - ♥**Rise of the Tomb Raider** - Probably my favourite series. I have fond
    memories of playing *Tomb Raider: Legend* on my PS2.
  - Mass Effect: Andromeda - I wish they made more games like this. Phenomenal
    world designs. Sped through the last quarter of the game but what I loved
    most was exploring each planet in the early stages.
  - Bioshock - I'd played it earlier on PC and sped through the first part. Not
    a fan of the choice system, but enjoyable otherwise.
  - Homefront Revolution - Ignore the reviews, this is a fun game. Very nice
    tension where you're initially avoiding an overpowered enemy, and slowly
    instigating enough of a rebellion to tip the balance.
  - Halo 5 - Decent single player campaign. Skipped the multiplayer bits. Had no
    idea what was going on story-wise, as I've never payed a Halo before.
  - Call of Duty - Infinite Warfare - Tolerable single player campaign.
    Titanfall 2 does this kind of thing a lot better.
  - Deus Ex: Mankind Divided - Badly wanted to like this game, but didn't.

## Backlog

Games i've bought that are in my queue

  - Middle Earth: Shadow of War
  - Dishonored 2
  - Witcher 3

## Abandoned

  - Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Wildlands - Getting tired of the whole ubisoft 
    open world formula so this is probably my last shot at that genre.
  - XCOM 2 - Too hard/stressful for me :( Great game though.
  - Guacamelee - About 60% of the way, I gave up at a frustratingly hard section.
  - Ori 1 - Lovely  game but I hate the frustrating experience.
  - Everspace - I don't like repeating the same thing again and again so it
    didn't suit my play style.
  - Fallout 4 - Somehow didn't click for me. Required a more serious investment
    than I'm able to make currently.
