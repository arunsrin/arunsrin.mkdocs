# Games - Xbox One

I prefer single-player Action Adventure open-world games. Bonus points if it has
a good story.

The ones in **bold** below are highly recommended.

## Completed
  
  - Thief - Enjoyable game. I loved their stealth implementation (over other
    games like Deus Ex: Mankind Divided). There were some truly thrilling
    moments during the game.
  
  - Far Cry 4 - Almost as good as 5. Better story as well. I think I like 5 more
    only because I played it first.
  
  - Shadow of the Tomb Raider - Fun game, great visuals and stealth sections.
    Little disappointed with the overall game. I can't put my hand to exactly
    what felt wrong.

  - **Far Cry 5** - Probably my favourite game on the console so far. Amazing
    open world, supports a lot of play styles, nice co-op AI partners.

  - **Rayman Legends** - My kids love this. Exquisite level design & music.
  
  - Life is Strange - I felt a little old playing this, but it was worth completing.

  - Gears of War 4 - Like a Michael Bay movie. Fun diversion for a few hours.

  - Batman: Arkham Knight - Disappointing. Too much driving.

  - INSIDE - Lovely little gem of a game.

  - Watch Dogs - Pretty fun game except for the brooding protagonist.
  
  - **Titanfall 2** - Absolutely phenomenal single-player campaign.
  
  - **Rise of the Tomb Raider** - Probably my favourite series. I have fond
    memories of playing *Tomb Raider: Legend* on my PS2.
  
  - Mass Effect: Andromeda - I wish they made more games like this. Phenomenal
    world designs. Sped through the last quarter of the game but what I loved
    most was exploring each planet in the early stages.

  - Bioshock - I'd played it earlier on PC and sped through the first part. Not
    a fan of the choice system, but enjoyable otherwise.

  - Homefront Revolution - Ignore the reviews, this is a fun game. Very nice
    tension where you're initially avoiding an overpowered enemy, and slowly
    instigating enough of a rebellion to tip the balance.

  - Halo 5 - Decent single player campaign. Skipped the multiplayer bits. Had no
    idea what was going on story-wise, as I've never payed a Halo before.

  - Call of Dury - Infinite Warfare - Tolerable single player campaign.
    Titanfall 2 does this kind of thing a lot better.

  - Deus Ex: Mankind Divided - Badly wanted to like this game, but didn't.

## Abandoned

  - XCOM 2 - Too hard/stressful for me :( Great game though.
  - Guacamelee - About 60% of the way, I gave up at a frustratingly hard section.
  - Ori 1 - Lovely game but I hate the frustrating experience.
  - Mighty No. 9 - Why do I keep buying hard platformers?
