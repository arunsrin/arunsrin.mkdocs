# ðŸŽ®Games

I prefer single-player Action Adventure open-world games. Bonus points if it has
a good story.

As of 2023 I primarily game on the following:

- [Xbox Series X](xbox.md)
- Nintendo Switch Lite

Prior to 2018 I have had:

- Xbox One S
- PS Vita
- Nintendo 3DS
- Nintendo Wii
- Nintendo DS Lite
- Playstation 2

Here are the games I've completed (i.e. seen the end credits, I'm not an
achievement hunter) in the past few years:

- [2024](2024.md)
- [2023](2023.md)
- [2022](2022.md)
- [2021](2021.md)
- [2020](2020.md)
- [2019 and before](2019-and-before.md)
