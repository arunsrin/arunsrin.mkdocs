# ðŸŽ®Games

I prefer single-player Action Adventure open-world games. Bonus points if it has
a good story.

Since 2018 I've had an [Xbox One S](xboxone.md).

In late-2021 I got a new laptop and it is great that Game Pass
Ultimate gives you access to a lot of the console portfolio, with
saves sync'd neatly between the two.

In 2022 I upgraded to an Xbox Series X.

Here are the games I've completed (i.e. seen the end credits, I'm not an
achievement hunter) in the past few years:

- [2022](2022.md)
- [2021](2021.md)
- [2020](2020.md)
- [2019 and before](2019-and-before.md)

## All time favourites: this decade

## Favourites: legacy

A long time ago, I played these games and loved the heck out of them:
