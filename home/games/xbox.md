# ðŸŽ®Xbox One

This page was getting too big so I've split up my gaming history to each year:

- [2023](2023.md)
- [2022](2022.md)
- [2021](2021.md)
- [2020](2020.md)
- [2019 and before](2019-and-before.md)

I love my xbox because this is the console where I have formed memories of:

- playing co-op games with my kids (like Rayman),
- playing through an entire series (like Gears and Halo),
- discovering games through Game Pass that I'd've never have otherwise
  tried (like The Gunk)
