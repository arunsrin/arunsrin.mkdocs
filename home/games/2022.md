## Mortal Kombat XI

I have fond memories of playing the first 4 MK's back in the day. So after a
long time, it was great to come back to this series. The cutscenes are really
nice and quite long, giving a movie-like feel in this game. The gameplay and
gore are fun as always.

## Halo 3

I had a month's gap midway through this game so I lost some context on what was
going on. But I enjoyed this game.

## Incomplete / In Progress

I spent January in Chennai and did not bring my console along. But I have a
low-end gaming laptop that has served as a fair replacement. So far, I've spent
most of my gaming time on these two:

- State of Decay 2: Juggernaut Edition - This seems like my ideal vision of a
  zombie game so I'm really enjoying it so far! I've just played a couple of
  hours but I like that it's more about resource management than shooting
  zombies.
- Lake - This is a peaceful game to balance with the one above. Abandoned
  because I wanted something with a bit more punch.
- Aragamai 2 - Really enjoying the stealth-ghost-ninja gameplay. New powers
  keep things interesting.
