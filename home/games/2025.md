## As Dusk Falls

An interactive, choose-your-own-adventure game about a robbery gone wrong. The
characters are interesting and well developed. I chose the straight-and-narrow
path but it might have been fun to see what would've happened if I picked
different paths.

## Watch Dogs: Legion

Although enjoyable, I probably agree with the general consensus here that this
is the weakest of the trilogy. The game reaches high, and the idea of
recruiting anyone is fun at first but is not something that made a very big
difference over time (apart from 1-2 characters with special powers like the
getaway driver).
