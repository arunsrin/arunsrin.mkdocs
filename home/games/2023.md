## Prodeus

An affectionate tribute to early FPSs like Doom. Very pretty to look at and a
blast to play. Each level is about 5 minutes long so it is perfect for quick
pick-up-and-play sessions. I stuck with the super shotgun for most of the game.
The easy mode is generous and it is great fun to clear a room with a few
rockets and leave a blood-splattered mess.

## South Park: The Stick of Truth

Highly recommended if you already like South Park. The animation is spot on and
the gameplay is really polished. I picked the Thief class for my character and
stuck with Butters as my side-kick for most of the game.

## â™¥**AC Odyssey: Legacy of the First Blade and The Fate of Atlantis**

For some reason I expected the DLCs to be a few hours long and to contain a few
extra missions. These turned out to be *huge*. I liked the first for its story
and the second for its worlds. As with any ubisoft game, open world fatigue
eventually set in and I was happy when it finally ended. But I had a lot of fun
for most of it: I spent a lot more time customizing my gear, adding engravings
and fine tuning.

Towards the last third, I got things just the way I like it: an assassin built
using the Pirate gear, with adrenaline recharges, 40% savings on Shadow of Nyx
and some pretty good boosts on all assassin skills. So I had quite a lot of fun
raiding forts invisibly and 1-hit killing pretty much every one in the game.

I've spent ~150 hours on AC Odyssey now and think I am done with it.
Considering how much I jump between games and prefer shorter experiences, it is
nice to have one exception that I have gone back to so many times in the last
few years.
