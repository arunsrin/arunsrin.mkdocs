## Hellblade 2

No HUD, no map, no health bar, no power-ups, no levelling up. Just a pure,
visceral, cinematic experience. Could never get into part 1 after multiple
attempts. But this one hit the sweet spot.

## â™¥**Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons** (Replay)

The second time I'm playing this gem. As good as I remember it. Highly
recommended.

## Control

I'm a bit torn on Remedy games because I loved Quantum Break but couldn't
finish Alan Wake. Anyway, Control is a lovely game with an excellent art style
and atmosphere. I had to tone down the difficulty considerably to enjoy the
game.. I did not have the patience to die-retry in the default difficulty.
Recommended.


## â™¥**Wasteland 3**

Tried this on a whim after some frustrating battles in Baldur's Gate
3, and ended up absolutely loving it. A beautifully dark, cynical,
funny dystopian setting with hard choices to make at every turn. The
abilities are fun and having a good distribution across the team
really makes things fun.
