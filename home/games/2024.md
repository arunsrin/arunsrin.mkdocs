## â™¥**Wasteland 3**

Tried this on a whim after some frustrating battles in Baldur's Gate
3, and ended up absolutely loving it. A beautifully dark, cynical,
funny dystopian setting with hard choices to make at every turn. The
abilities are fun and having a good distribution across the team
really makes things fun.
