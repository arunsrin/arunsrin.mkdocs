# 🐧About

I’m a software engineer in Bangalore who is addicted to [books](books/index.md). Classic
Literature ([Vladimir Nabokov](books/reviews/despair.md)), Popular Science ([Richard
Dawkins](archive/heroes/dawkins.md)) and Science Fiction (Greg Egan) are the
genres I prefer. The picture at the end of this page shows all the books I own,
as of Feb 2015.

I seem to prefer breadth over depth, and enjoy playing games (mostly
on my [Xbox Series X](games/xbox.md) these days), fiddling with
GNU/Linux (Fedora or WSL2 on windows), [Emacs](tech/editors.md) and
[Python](tech/programming/python.md).

I occassionally like to draw -- but not as well as I'd like.

I have an adorable little daughter (Update Mar-2016 — and son!).

## 🐍About this site

I use [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) - a lovely python-based static site
generator - for this website. I write content in markdown and push it to a
[github repo](https://github.com/arunsrin/arunsrin.mkdocs), and a trigger there
builds and pushes the site to [Cloudflare
Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/). 

There are some tiny easter eggs here and there.. look around!

These days I primarily write content using vim on a terminal.
