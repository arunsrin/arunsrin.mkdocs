# About

I’m a software engineer in Bangalore who is addicted to books. Classic
Literature (Vladimir Nabokov), Popular Science (Richard Dawkins) and Science
Fiction (Greg Egan) are the genres I prefer. The picture at the end of this
page shows all the books I own, as of Feb 2015.

I seem to prefer breadth over depth, and enjoy playing games (mostly on my Xbox
One these days), fiddling with GNU/Linux (Fedora, MATE, Emacs) and Python. 

I have an adorable little daughter (Update Mar-2016 — and son!)
