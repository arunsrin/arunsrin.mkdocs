I’m a software engineer in Bangalore who is addicted to books. Classic
Literature (Vladimir Nabokov), Popular Science (Richard Dawkins) and
Science Fiction (Greg Egan) are the genres I prefer. The picture at
the end of this page shows all the books I own, as of Feb 2015.

I seem to prefer breadth over depth, and enjoy playing games (on my
3DS and Vita mostly these days), fiddling with GNU/Linux (Fedora,
MATE, Emacs) and some Python. One of these days I’ll pick up a skill
and drill down into its innards. Just wait.

I have an adorable little daughter (Update Mar-2016 — and son!)
