# ðŸ“ºMovies

I'm a bit of a movie snob and prefer ones where the
director's love shines through. Commercially-focused movies
are quite boring. I like to second-guess what happens next,
and thoroughly enjoy movies that 'surprise' me.

## Favourite Directors

- Alex Garland - The Beach, Ex Machina, 28 Days Later
- Denis Villenueve - Arrival, Bladerunner 2049
- Joel and Ethan Coen - Fargo, No Country For Old Men, O Brother Where Art Thou
- Guillerma del Toro - Pan's Labyrinth, Hellboy

## The best of the best

My all-time favourite movies are:

- The Lord of the Rings trilogy. You can see the love for
the source material just shine through in every scene.
- The Fall. A love letter to story-telling and movies.
- Pan's Labyrinth. A dark fantasy from a great Director.

## Science Fiction

- Gattaca. My favourite science fiction movie.
- Arrival. From one of my favourite contemporary directors.
- Everything Everywhere All At Once. An unforgettable
experience.
- The Matrix. Keanu Reeves, martial arts, philosophy and
sci-fi make for an excellent combination.

## Comedies

- Kung Fu Hustle. The funniest action-comedy you will ever
see.
- Hot Fuzz / Shaun of the Dead. Anything from Edgar Wright,
Simon Pegg and Nick Frost really.


## Drama

- Network. Impossible to imagine this was made in the 70's.
- Glengarry Glen Ross. A stellar cast and phenomenal writing.

# ðŸ“ºTV shows

- The Wire. The gold standard for television. This made me a
kinder, more thoughtful person. Genuinely world-changing.
- Blackadder. Let's pretend Season 1 doesn't exist. But 2-4
has some of the funniest episodes ever made.
- Fargo. One bad season again, but the rest makes for great,
funny, dark, entertainment.
