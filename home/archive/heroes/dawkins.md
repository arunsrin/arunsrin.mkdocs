# ðŸ§¬ Richard Dawkins

## Why

Dawkins is my role model because his books played a major role in
forming my understanding of the world. His writing is crisp and clear:
he knows his stuff and can defend it well, so he doesn't need to
obfuscate or confuse. He has strong opinions on religion and is not
afraid to share them.

## The Blind Watchmaker

This was my first brush with a Dawkins box was probably the single
most influential, mind-changing experience I've ever had with a
book. Until I'd read him, I didn't have well-formed mental models of
scepticism, religion, or evolutionary biology.

This book gives a thoroughly convincing argument for the Darwinian
theory of evolution. Dawkins is a master at this. He builds a
seemingly-impossible case, Paley's *Watchmaker Analogy*, and proceeds
to demolish it to pieces in the rest of the book.

## Book recommendations

His early books are around the wonders of science and evolutionary
biology. I recommend pretty much everything he's written, but these
early ones are my personal favourites.

- *The Blind Watchmaker*
- *Unweaving the Rainbow*
- *A Devil's Chaplain*
