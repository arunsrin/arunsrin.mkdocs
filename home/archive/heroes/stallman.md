# üêß Richard Stallman

## Why

Stallman is the heart of the Free Software Foundation and the reason
for the GNU in [GNU/Linux](../../tech/linux/index.md). He represents a certain
purity and conviction that is hard to get in our industry these days. 

I sit strongly on the GPL side of the GPL vs MIT license
debate. Software that use GPL licenses are like life forms that
contain genes, in the sense that the license carries the promise that
the software can evolve and take new forms, while continuing to be
open and accessible. MIT-based Licenses don't ensure their own
survival in the same way.

I see Popper's [Paradox of
Intolerance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_tolerance) as
another valid reason to favour a GPL license over MIT: Free software
can remain free and thrive only if it is intolerant of non-freeness.

I admire Stallman because of his unrelenting desire to stand by his
principles. He sees the dark side of technology, *Black Mirror* style,
and history invariably shows him to have called it correctly, time and
again.
