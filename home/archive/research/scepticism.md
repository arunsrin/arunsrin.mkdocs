# ðŸ’­ Scepticism

I feel lucky to have grown up as the internet was starting out. I honed my
debating skills in forums (talk.origins, James Randi's forum, and so on) and
feel I have a pretty good bullshit detector thanks to that training.

Sometimes I get into arguments with people about some fairly interesting
topics. Other times it's on stupid things they read on social media and swallow
without a second thought. Here are some well written articles on interesting
topics.

## Behavioural Economics

## GMOs

People fear new technology. GMOs interest me because they stand on the thin
line between fascinating technology and scary dystopia. I think they are a
powerful tool for humanity and research in them should be encouraged.

## Cell phone 'Radiation'

There's more of this going around these days, with some geniuses linking 5G
towers to COVID-19.

## Homeopathy

- [Why you can't trust Homeopathy](http://www.1023.org.uk/why-you-cant-trust-homeopathy.php)

## Vaccines

There are fortunately no stupid people in my immediate community who are
vaccine-averse.

- [Lots of info on RationalWiki](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Anti-vaccination_movement)
- [Mercury, Vaccines, and Autism](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2376879/)

## Miscellaneous

- [How to avoid swallowing War Propaganda](https://www.currentaffairs.org/2020/01/how-to-avoid-swallowing-war-propaganda)

## Internet cranks

- Mark McCarron is his own internet rabbit hole. Here's an article of his on a Spam/Email alternative: [We've found the perfect solution to spam â€¢ The Register](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2003/07/09/weve_found_the_perfect_solution/). He's also written a cipher called crystalline. Read his comments to see how defensive and out of touch with reality he is.
