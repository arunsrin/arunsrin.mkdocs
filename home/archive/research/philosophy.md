# ðŸ’­ Philosophy / Morality

## Personal stance

I find myself leaning towards Stoicism quite a bit. It's core principles are
around [the Dichotomy of
Control](https://thestoicsage.com/dichotomy-of-control/), i.e. understand the
things that are outside your control and those that are within, and focus on
the latter.

A virtuous life - according to Stoics - is one where we live in accordance with
nature and cultivate our mind and character - the only things that we really
have control over.


## Some good books

I highly recommend *Think Like A Stoic*, by Massimo Pigliucci. I took some
notes of it [here](../../books/reviews/think-like-a-stoic.md).

- The Happiness Hypothesis and The Righteous Mind, by Jonathan Haidt
- The Mind's I, by Douglas Hofstadter
- Knowledge, Reality and Value by Michael Huemer
