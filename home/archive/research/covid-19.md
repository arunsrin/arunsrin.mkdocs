# ðŸ¦  COVID-19 References

I'm keeping a diary of interesting links to track the COVID-19 epidemic.

## Global links

- Archive of [a good bunch of links on SSC](https://web.archive.org/web/20200618093658/https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/03/02/coronavirus-links-speculation-open-thread/).
- A rationalist [prepper](https://putanumonit.com/2020/02/27/seeing-the-smoke/). Articles like this helped me prepare about a month before shit hit the fan.
- [Why You Must Act Now](https://medium.com/@tomaspueyo/coronavirus-act-today-or-people-will-die-f4d3d9cd99ca) - Nice comprehensive article that was doing the rounds in the early days.
- Comprehensive [arstechnica coverage](https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/04/dont-panic-the-comprehensive-ars-technica-guide-to-the-coronavirus/).
- Why the whole test kit availability thing was messed up in the early days: [they were tainted](https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/04/cdcs-failed-coronavirus-tests-were-tainted-with-coronavirus-feds-confirm/).
- [Timeline of WHO's response](https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/29-06-2020-covidtimeline).
- How [New Zealand beat COVID-19](https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/06/new-zealand-eliminates-covid-19-lifts-all-social-distancing/).
- A nice summary of [the Vaccine Protocols](https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2020/09/21/the-vaccine-protocols).

## Scepticism

- A paper that was doing the rounds on Whatsapp was [retracted](https://www.statnews.com/2020/02/03/retraction-faulty-coronavirus-paper-good-moment-for-science/).
- [HCQ results](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/04/21/malaria-drug-virginia-coronavirus-study-198590) after certain clowns made a big deal of it.
- Lack of clarity on [remdesivir's effectiveness](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/04/200429134020.htm). It may be [worse than doing nothing](https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/05/hydroxychloroquine-linked-to-increase-in-covid-19-deaths-heart-risks/).
- Social media scrambling as always, fighting [misinformation](https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/07/plandemic-video-judy-mikovits/).

## India-specific links

- [Trying to predict the curve](https://www.thehindu.com/data/data-where-does-india-stand-on-the-coronavirus-curve/article31137679.ece?homepage=true), way back in March.
- [Some more scenarios](https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/coronavirus-outbreak-15-lakh-delhi-covid-19-cases-in-optimistic-scenario-centres-estimate-2199464), from March.
- Reasons for doubt: [India under-reporting TB cases for years](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/India-under-reported-TB-for-15-years-WHO/article16070274.ece).
- [So cruel :(](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/coronavirus-madhya-pradesh-pushes-working-hours-from-eight-to-12-in-factories/article31527330.ece?homepage=true). Politicians and corporations put worker rights last.
- India has an [Integrated Disease Surveillance Program](https://idsp.nic.in/index4.php?lang=1&level=0&linkid=406&lid=3689) that is meant to handle epidemics like this. They had daily updates until COVID-19 hit, and ICMR stepped in instead.
- [How to make even a fucking epidemic about religion](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/08/how-lives-were-destroyed-under-cover-of-lockdown-in-a-small-indian-town).
- [ICMR research](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/news-analysis-india-may-have-undercounted-cases/article31822079.ece) that implies 7 lakh infected in a few districts, when the nation-wide count at that time was 3.4 lakhs (!!)

## Bangalore-specific links

- [BBMP daily bulletins](http://bbmp.gov.in/en/covid19bulletins). Very nice charts.
- [Hospital beds allocated and available currently](http://chbms.bbmpgov.in/portal/reports1/hreport.html).
