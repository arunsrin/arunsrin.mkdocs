# Resume | Arun Srinivasan


I'm a Platform Engineer / Tech Lead with 17 years of experience in the
industry.
14 of these are in Cisco, the most recent of which have been in Webex.

---

## Tech


I am proficient in building platforms on:

- *k8s* and the general Cloud Native ecosystem
- *AWS* and *Openstack* Clouds
- Premise / Edge Platforms
- Anything *Linux*

I <3 *Python* and it is my go-to language for most tasks.

I have a strong background and interest in the *Security* side of things and
have been involved in hardening all the products I've worked on.

## History

Chronologically, going backwards:

### Webex, current
- Lead a team and architected / evoved an IaaS Edge service to a pure PaaS that
runs and integrates well with k8s.
- Lead a team that owns the cloud-managed, cloud-operated premise platform in
Cisco Webex.

### Webex, early days
- Built the build systems, clustering, Rest APIs, CI/CD integration and
Observability for IaaS Edge Services.
- Built the Infrastructure Automation for these services.

### Cisco Collaboration
- Worked on the original premise product of the above that ran on Cisco
Routers.
- Was part of the pilot team that took this to the cloud and migrated all
existing instances to the latter.
- Was a test engineer for the premise product, where I liked to break things
and automate them.

### Wipro
- Worked at Wipro early in my career, where I primarily caught the Linux bug.

---

## Other

I have become reasonably good at *planning* large projects, breaking them down, etc.

My english is impeccable, and I can usually *communicate* well too.

I can pick up things fast and my strengths are in my *breadth* rather than depth.

I like to *understand and communicate* complex ideas simply.
