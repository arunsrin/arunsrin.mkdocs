<h1 id="alexander-the-great">📃 Alexander the Great</h1>
<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>Born in 356 BCE, king of Macedon from 336 to his death in 323.</p>
<h2 id="sources">Sources</h2>
<p>People used to maintain Astronomical Diaries to monitor positions of
planets, and unusual phenomena like comets and eclipses. Some of them
were seen as omens and used to decide how to protect the king. They
are good texts that chronicle his deeds.</p>
<p>Later accounts lionize him as they were meant to serve as inspiration
for their audience: the Roman elite. So they are not very reliable
even if there are multiple accounts of the same story.</p>
<p>Coins printed with his portrait during his reign depict him with ram's
horns, indicating he was the son of the Egyptian God Amun.</p>
<h1 id="before-alexander">Before Alexander</h1>
<p>A Persian King, Darius I, around 513 BCE, led an army from Asia to
Europe and established his territories there. Macedonia was given to
Amyntas, who was succeeded by Alexander I. In the meantime Darius was
succeeded by his son Xerxes. Alexander's great-great-great-grandson
was Alexander III aka Alexander the Great.</p>
<p>The Achaemenid empire was established by Cyrus the Great, and passed
on eventually to a distant relative Darius through a coup.</p>
<p>The kings led a nomadic life, traveling from one camp to another
throughout the year, partly for war and partly to be in cooler
climates.</p>
<p>The Achaemenid empire's peak was under Xerxes when most of northern
and central Greece - including Athens - was conquered in 480. His
fleet was defeated soon and his army driven back to Asia. An
Athenian-led alliance slowly took control back. Then Persians again
took control of the east Aegean coast. Increasing distrust between the
Greek cities eventually led to the Peloponnesian War between Athens
and Sparta and their allies (431-404), with both sides trying to win
support of the Persian kings Artaxerxes and Darius II. Cyrus helped
the Spartans with naval power forcing the Athenians to surrender. So
the Spartans in return gave up the Greek cities on the Asian mainland
to Persia.</p>
<p>After Darius II, relations broke down again. The Athenian writer
Xenophon describes this in his <em>Anabasis</em>. Artaxerxes finally
established a King's peace there. </p>
<p>Meanwhile in Macedon, Amyntas was succeeded by Alexander I. Kings were
polygamous so they had a lot of heirs, leading to a period of
instability whenever a king died. So his successor Perdiccas II took
years to establish his power. A few kings later the throne came to
Philip II, ALexander the Great's father.</p>
<p>Philip II transformed Macedonia's fortunes with diplomacy, military
reorganization and skilled generalship. Eventually all the Greek
cities except Sparta swore allegiance to him, establishing the League
of Corinth. Philip next declared war on Persia.</p>
<h2 id="prince-alexander-in-the-macedonian-court">Prince: Alexander in the Macedonian Court</h2>
<p>Alexander was born in July 356. One of his historians, Plutarch, says
he was educated by Aristotle. A lot of mythical stories around his
birth and childhood have come up. He was attached to his horse
Bucephalas.</p>
<p>He was attending the wedding of his sister Cleopatra to his uncle,
Alexander of Epirus. His father Philip was assassinated there, the
reasons are still unclear. So it came to him to seek revenge against
the Persians for the destruction they'd caused earlier.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="warrior-alexanders-army">Warrior: Alexander's Army</h1>
<p>Alexander dealt with uprisings in areas close to Macedonia, and later
with Thebes. He then crossed into Asia and fought the Persians in 3
major battles. Then Porus. Then a bunch of cities on the west coast of
Anatolia and the Levant. And a long insurgency in Afghanistan, and
Pakistan.</p>
<p>The army was made up of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cavalrymen with lances,</li>
<li>The Macedonian phalanx, armed with pikes,</li>
<li>Flanked by soldiers with swords, spears and round shields,</li>
<li>Light-armed trooops with javelins, bows and slings.</li>
</ul>
<p>A large number of camp-followers, attendants, slaves, hangers-on
etc. were also present, pretty much outnumbering the soliders.</p>
<p>A <em>siege train</em> comprising catapults, battering rams, siege towers
(that were dismantled and loaded into carts), also followed the main
army.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="commander-alexander-and-the-greeks">Commander: Alexander and the Greeks</h1>
<p>Would-be Greek leaders often looked to opposing kings (Philip, the
Persians) for political funding. Rivalries and infghting often led to
exiles. Philip II defeated Thebes and Athens. He exiled the Theban
politicians and garrisoned the city but Athens was left in peace. So
they allied with him.</p>
<p>A more formalized agreement was then made, known as the <em>League of
Corinth</em>. This was a campaign led by Philip (the <em>hegemon</em>) against
Persia. After his death, Alexader renewed the alliance but Thebes
revolted. As punishment for the rebellion, Alexander attacked
them. They were completely destroyed..</p>
<p>Sparta was the only city outside of these happenings. They were not
part of the <em>League</em> and had lost a lot of territory and
dominance. They chose to side with Darius instead.</p>
<p>Athens was Alexander's favoured city. The politicians were divided in
their support of Alexander.</p>
<h2 id="exiles">Exiles</h2>
<p>One of Alexander's acts was to order the cities to take back their
exiles. This was a bit problematic as individuals were not allowed to
own land in cities that they didn't belong to. So exiles had to find
other ways of supporting themselves, e.g. fight as a hoplite or
cavalryman. When Alexander returned to Greece and disbanded his army,
these were the ones who needed somewhere to go, hence the order to
allow them back to their cities.</p>
<p>This order challenged the autonomy of the cities that had enforced
these exiles initially. Exiles had to be accommodated alongside other
citizens who had taken over their lands, and disputes arose.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="pharaoh-alexander-and-egypt">Pharaoh: Alexander and Egypt</h1>
<p>With Greece sorted out, Alexander now came to Egypt in late 332. Egypt
had gone through quite a bit of churn, with multiple transfer of
power. Two events that happened in Alexander's time there are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The foundation of the city of Alexandria</li>
<li>his visit to the oracle of Amun at Siwa</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="alexandria">Alexandria</h2>
<p>Through trade, had become the largest city in the world at that
time. Joined the Mediterranean world to the East. The Library gathered
all of Greek literature. After Alexander's death, Ptolemy took control
of Egypt and proclaimed himself King. He used Memphis as his capital
though. He and his successors made Alexandria the cultural hub that
it's famous for, not Alexander. Also, Alexander founded many other
cities called Alexandria during his conquests. So overall it is not
very clear that he had very large plans for the famous one in Egypt.</p>
<p>Stories of omens surrounding the City's foundations are probably
whitewashing by future rulers to associate the city with Alexander.</p>
<h2 id="the-oracle-of-amun">The Oracle of Amun</h2>
<p>Apparently a turning point in Alexander's perception of himself. At
major festivals, the image of the God would be carried by eight
priests and people could ask questions. The image swaying would
indicate an answer. Or they'd keep two pieces of paper in front and
the image swaying towards one of them would indicate that decision.</p>
<p>Amun / Ammon / Zeus Ammon. Depicted as a man with a ram's horns.</p>
<p>Greek narratives tended to have a spoken exchange between the enquirer
and priest (e.g. the Oracle at Delphi), and this makes for a better
story than swaying idols. So past writers have written accounts where
Alexander asked questions about (a) his father's murders being
punished and (b) whether he'd rule the world. The response was that
his father could not be harmed by mortals (i.e. he had divine
parentage) but Philip's death had been avenged. And yes he would go on
to rule the world.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="pharoah-alexander">Pharoah Alexander</h1>
<p>Memphis was the administrative center of Egypt. Alexander traveled to
several cities across the kingdom where the allies renewed their
alliance with him. His travel concluded at Memphis where he was
crowned as the Pharaoah. Greek authors apparently skim past this, as
their narrative was more around Alexander's gradual corruption and
adoption of 'barbarian' practices. The Egypt bit seems to be too early
for that plot.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="king-of-the-world-alexander-and-persia">King of the World: Alexander and Persia</h1>
<p>At Gordium, the old capital of Phrygia, is where the Gordian Knot
story happens. Whoever could undo a knot connecting a cart to a yoke
it would be the King of the World. He fulfilled the prophecy by
cutting it (in other tellings, he pulls a peg that held the knot
together).</p>
<h2 id="susa">Susa</h2>
<p>Alexander started adopting Persian clothes and customs around this
time, which disturbed his Macedonian companions. There is a
possibility he saw himself as Darius's successor, and wanted to move
his capital from Maceondia to Susa and Babylon.</p>
<h2 id="the-burning-of-persepolis">The Burning of Persepolis</h2>
<p>The palace of Persepolis had been built by Darius and
Xerxes. Alexander had it burned as symbolic revenge for their attacks
on Athens.</p>
<h2 id="dressing-as-a-persian">Dressing as a Persian</h2>
<p>Similar to how he adopted Egyptian customs and the role of Pharoah, he
started doing the same in Persia as well. Moralists claim that this
was where his decline started. Depending on how you read, they either
say that his companions were suspicious and hostile towards this, or
that the companions were getting into luxurious living while Alexander
was the one practising frugality and self control.</p>
<h2 id="court-ceremonial">Court Ceremonial</h2>
<p>There is some controversy around whether or not he expected people to
prostrate themselves in his presence, an act that historians claimed
normal in Persian courts (it was not; it was only required of defeated
enemies). </p>
<h2 id="alexanders-queens">Alexander's Queens</h2>
<p>Marriage was used as a means to maintain friendly relations with
neighboring kingdoms. His first wife Rhoxane had his next 2 wives
killed soon after Alexander's death, to protect the claim to throne of
her unborn child.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="traveller-alexander-in-afghanistan-and-pakistan">Traveller: Alexander in Afghanistan and Pakistan</h1>
<p>He spent five years starting 330 on a new campaign. Most preachy
historians of the time dwell on this period. This was also the point
where his soldiers refused to go further on.</p>
<p>Alexander's plan in Afghanistan was to defeat Darius III. But the
latter was killed by his general Bessus, so Alexander claimed that, as
king, he was avenging Darius's death instead.</p>
<p>There are multiple stories around Alexander crossing the river
Jaxartes. He married Rhoxane in this camppaign, which consolidated his
control of the region.</p>
<h2 id="to-the-indus-valley">To the Indus Valley</h2>
<p>From Afghanistan he now went to the Hindu Kush into what is now
Pakistan. Four tributaries flowing into the Indus from the Himalayas
were controlled by a number of rival Indian princes. Rather than
appointing satraps here, he confirmed those princes if they accepted
his authority. One ruler, Taxiles, accepted. His neighbour, Porus, did
not. Alexander defeated Porus in a major battle.</p>
<h2 id="turning-back">Turning back</h2>
<p>He continued eastwards. On the banks of the Hyphasis, his soldiers
refused to continue. Alexander shut himself in his tent and refused to
come out. He then claimed he'd go alone, but the soldiers didn't
relent. Finally he submitted to their will and turned back. Current
historians think this is apocryphal too, like a lot of the stories
around Alexander. He next turned south towards the ocean rather than
turnin back the same way he came.</p>
<h2 id="to-the-ocean">To the Ocean</h2>
<p>No texts from India survive, so we're stuck with the unreliable
Alexander historians again. He faced fierce resistance in
Punjab. Chandragupta Maurya visited him here, and would take over most
of India after Alexander left.</p>
<h2 id="the-gedrosian-desert">The Gedrosian Desert</h2>
<p>His final campaign, notorious and misunderstood. He wanted a naval
route to reach Mesopotamia from Afghanistan. But for this the fleet
that he had readied should have been supplied as it sailed along the
inhospitable Iranian coast. This was why he led his land force through
the region of Gedrosia in southern Iran on his way from the Indus back
to Pasargadae. This would make sure fresh water, supplies and grains
were available to the fleet as it followed.</p>
<p>The stories here tell of Alexander losing most of his army in the
arduous desert journey.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="doomed-to-die-alexander-in-babylon">Doomed to die: Alexander in Babylon</h1>
<p>Final chapter of his life. The scholars who produced astronomical
diaries were also chroniclers of the kings. So we have good records
of the events without the moral commentary.</p>
<p>Eight years earlier, in September 331, there had been a lunar eclipse
that foretold that the king would die, his son would not succeed him,
and the new ruler would come from the west and rule for eight
years. Darius indeed did die, and Alexander succeeded him. And those
eight years were up.</p>
<p>A few months before he entered, there was a lunar and solar eclipse,
again a bad omen, that the King of the World would die.</p>
<h2 id="death">Death</h2>
<p>At the age of 32, he caught a fever and spent the last few days of his
life lying on his couch, mainly conducting the religious rituals
required of him as a king.</p>
<p>Later on, stories circulated about him being poisoned, most likely to
damage the reputation of the accused.</p>
<p>Another story is about his last words. Some report that he lost his
speech in the last few days of his life. But the story is that when
asked to whom he wanted to leave the kingdom, he apparently said, "to
the strongest."</p>
<p>There was in-fighting in the next few decades to control his empire or
carve out parts of it. His body was sent back to Macedonia but
intercepted by Ptolemy in Egypt to legitimize his rule.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="after-alexander">After Alexander</h1>
<p>Caesar was often compared to Alexander. The Senate voted to put up a
statute of him titled 'The invincible god'. Similar to a supposed
letter written by Aristotle to Alexander, Cicero attempted to caution
Caesar. So story tellers / historians liked to portray Alexander's
journey as a descent into tyranny.</p>
<p>As Rome went from one king to another, portrayals of Alexander changed
accordingly. Under Caligula's rule he was portrayed negatively; under
Hadrian and Trajan, positively. </p>
<p>In medieval times, stories around Alexander became more fanciful. </p>
<p>More scrutiny happened in the Enlightement Age with new translations
and editions. His 'civilizing mission' was used to justify British
rule in India, and events in America led to publications that showed
the dangers of democracy and the superiority of constitutional
monarchy.</p>
<p>Basically he has taken a role of hero or villain based on the
narrative the historians of that time wanted to create.</p></div>
